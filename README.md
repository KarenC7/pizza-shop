# Pizza Shop - Coding Challenge

## Description

Develop a component that bakes virtual pizzas.  It should be a command line program that accepts an order from the user on the command line and bakes the virtual pizza.  See the `com.axosclearing.codingchallenge.pizzashop.Main` class for a starting point.

## Requirements

* Read available ingredients and quantities from the provided ingredient_inventory.csv file.
* Accept orders on the command line interactively as a list of ingredients terminated with a blank line.
* On receipt of an order, simulate baking the pizza in the background for 30 seconds.
* Allow the user to enter another order while a pizza is baking.
* Immediately notify the user when a pizza has finished baking.
* Ingredient quantities should be decreased as new orders are filled.
* Immediately notify the user when they order ingredients that are no longer available.
